# <center>Executive Summary </center>

<div align = "center">
This Data Innovation Health Check report provides an overview of the data science opportunities available for Cath's Cabs. The DIA and Cath's Cabs identified the following data innovation area as a priority:
- Auto-Tagging of Entities in Research Notes 

The DIA believe that Cath's Cabs can utilise research notes by exploring the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER). Such analysis may be used to extract organisation names within large pieces of text. 

We have also identified the following data innovation areas: 

- Detecting Emotion within Discussion Comments
- Automatic Summarisation of Research Notes
- Topic Modelling of Research Notes 

We have graded the data innovation areas in relation to originality and impact. AutoTagging of Entities in Research Notes and Automatic Summarisation of Research Notes are ranked as high in impact to reflect the valuable information Cath's Cabs may gain from classifying research notes and summarising large notes into smaller, compact summarisations. 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was not applicable for this Data Innovation Health Check report due to the format and type of data supplied by Cath's Cabs. Therefore, the Data Readiness Assessment was based solely on the answers provided in the Data Readiness Consultation survey. The data readiness framework scores achieved by Cath's Cabs suggest that the organisation is well prepared to undertake data-intensive and data science work. Recommendations have been provided for several steps which would improve data readiness scores in the _Data Readiness_ section of this Data Innovation Health Check report. 

To discover the relevant data science techniques behind these innovation areas, including a proof-of-concept demonstration we developed specifically for Cath's Cabs, please go to _Possibilities for Data Innovation_. 

To see how you can get started on developing the above data innovation areas please go to _Pathway to Data Innovation_.
