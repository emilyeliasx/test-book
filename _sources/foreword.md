Foreword
=======================

The Data Innovation Accelerator (DIA) at Cardiff University was set up in early 2019 as a new approach to translating research discoveries into tangible benefits for society, business and the environment. Since then, we have established a robust programme to support small companies to understand the potential benefits of data science for their business. By the end of 2019, we had carried out data innovation health checks for 20 companies, providing an introductory exploration of data science including time series forecasting, natural language processing and optimisation techniques to identify opportunities for analysis of data for the benefit of your company. 

We feel passionate that data science has the power to affect transformative change in small companies. Data that a company may hold about itself through logistics, operations management or customer service activities can provide a wealth of new insights and decision-making tools; data science can unlock substantial new knowledge. 

The DIA responds directly to the varying needs of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Wales. While some companies know exactly what their largescale data could offer in terms of planning and optimising manufacturing processes, they may not have the in-house resources to do anything further. Other companies have high levels of expertise and skills in their sector but have not yet had the opportunity to explore the wide-ranging possibilities that engineering, modelling and analysis of data can offer. 

As Cardiff University’s research capacity in data science, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and software engineering goes from strength to strength, the DIA is ideally placed to play an important role in ensuring University expertise has a real impact in Wales. UK-wide initiatives, including the Government’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Sector Deal and Industrial Strategy, are a further strong indication that data science and its associated activities will be a core and dynamic part of the country’s economic future. 

The DIA team is here to help SMEs in the East Wales region to take important steps into data science and we hope that this report and action plan is a useful and interesting tool at the start of your journey.
