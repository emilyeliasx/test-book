# Product Correlation using Association Rule Mining

Association rule mining is an area of machine learning which can be used to help find frequent patterns, correlations, associations, or causal structures in datasets. The ability to automatically detect products that are commonly bought together and understand patterns within Cath's Cabs data will provide a greater insight into:

Basket data analysis: the ability to analyse the association of product orders or sales
Cross marketing of related or socially connected products or services

Various techniques and methodologies have been developed to address the automatic identification of associated products. In this concept work, we demonstrate how the Apriori algorithm can be used to determine what products are associated from several retail orders provided as a part of London South Bank University's dataset. Cath's Cabs could apply their dataset using the same algorithm to have insights into insurance purchases.
