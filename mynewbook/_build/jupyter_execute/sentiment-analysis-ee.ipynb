    "The ability to automatically detect the sentiment expressed in textual data will provide Cath's Cabs with a greater insight into the nuance of the comments associated with research notes. This functionality will support further analysis into the correlation between a comment and a researcher's notes. For example, a comment that has a positive sentiment may be linked to a user gaining valuable information from such note and could contribute to a ranking system in terms of usefulness of research notes. Such a feature could greatly innovate Cath's Cabs's software. \n",
